## About Me

I am a Techno-Functional IT Professional with strong expertise in SQL engineering, backend development, enterprise systems, and financial applications. My work focuses on building solutions that are scalable, reliable, and aligned with real-world business operations.

I operate at the intersection of technology and business, translating functional requirements into robust technical architectures and ensuring seamless execution across teams and systems.

Previously, I served as Manager – IT Department at Mirae Finance Group, leading a 10-member engineering team, managing multi-application environments, coordinating with vendors, and delivering end-to-end project implementations across critical financial modules.

My core strengths include SQL, database design, performance optimization, data migration, patch release management, and production support, with a consistent track record of improving system stability and operational efficiency.

I am currently pursuing an MS in Data Science in Berlin, expanding my capabilities in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and advanced analytics to build intelligent, data-driven systems.

My approach is shaped by a strong problem-solving mindset, grounded in both technical depth and functional understanding. I excel at bridging gaps between users, systems, and business objectives to deliver solutions that create meaningful impact.

I am passionate about building systems that are robust, scalable, and purposeful—whether backend services, data pipelines, or full-scale enterprise modules.
